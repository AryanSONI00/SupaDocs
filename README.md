# 📝 Supabase Notes App

A secure, user-specific note-taking app powered by **Supabase**.
Each user can **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** their own notes —
and **only their own** — thanks to strict **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies.

## 🚀 Features

-   🔐 **Authentication** using Supabase Auth
-   🗃️ **Notes database** with `uuid`, `title`, `content`, and `created_at`
-   ⚙️ **Row Level Security (RLS)** to isolate user data
-   ✏️ **CRUD operations** scoped to each user's `user_id`

## WORK IN PROGRESS!!
STAY TUNED
